 * <p>
 * {@code require = 0} on the sky pair is deliberate: if a future Minecraft renames this, the flag stays false and
 * {@code position_tex_color} is treated as an overlay everywhere. That degrades to a cosmetic sky artifact rather than
 * wiping entity classification, which is the safer of the two failures.

     * at HEAD -- sky replacers do exactly this -- returns through a return instruction inserted by its own callback,

     * scene reads as sun. That is the exact shape of the bug the sky-stage split was written to fix, so it must not be
     * reachable by a third party leaving the flag stuck.
     * <p>
     * Clearing at HEAD costs one field write per frame and makes the flag's lifetime strictly bounded: it can only be
     * true between the beginning of {@code renderSky} and the end of the level pass.
