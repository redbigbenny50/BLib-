/**
 * A copy of the level's depth buffer, taken while it still describes the world.
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2> Vanilla clears the depth buffer before drawing the item in hand, so the first-person hand
 * cannot clip into terrain. That happens inside the level pass — which means by the time any post effect runs,
 * {@code MainTarget}'s depth attachment describes <em>only the held item</em>. Everything else reads as the far plane.
 * <p>
 * The symptom is deceptive rather than obviously broken: a post effect that reconstructs world position from depth gets
 * plausible-looking values for the hand and far-plane values for the entire world, so it silently does nothing
 * everywhere except a small patch in the corner of the screen. It was diagnosed exactly that way — a debug view lit up
 * on the held block and nowhere else.
 * <p>
 * So the depth is copied at the end of the level pass, before that clear, and post effects sample the copy. This is the
 * same shape as {@link BLibTerrainMaskFixup}: capture during the level pass what the post pass can no longer see.
 * <h2>Cost</h2> One {@code glCopyTexSubImage2D} of a depth texture per frame, which is a GPU-side copy with no readback
 * and no synchronisation. It only runs when at least one post effect is active, so a frame with no vision running pays
 * nothing.
