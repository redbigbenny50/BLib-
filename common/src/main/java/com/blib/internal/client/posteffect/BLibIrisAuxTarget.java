/**
 * A PRIVATE FRAMEBUFFER THAT HOSTS THE SIX AUXILIARY ATTACHMENTS WHILE A SHADER PACK OWNS THE MAIN RENDER TARGET.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why this exists.</b> Everything the predator vision needs already works under a pack except for one thing: there
 * is nowhere to write the classification. Iris owns the main render target, and bolting our attachments onto it is
 * precisely the bug that produced a grossly overexposed screen. So we render the classification into a framebuffer of
 * our own, which Iris knows nothing about and cannot be corrupted by.
 * <p>
 * <b>What makes this cheap.</b> Three facts measured from live logs, not assumed:
 * <ol>
 * <li>BLib still patches all twelve vanilla entity shaders while a pack is loaded, so the shaders that produce the
 * classification are compiled and ready \u2014 they simply never get bound during Iris's own passes.</li>
 * <li>Iris does not intercept shader binding, on either the {@code RenderSystem} route or the raw
 * {@code glUseProgram} route: 162 samples with a pack live, every one bound the program that was asked for.</li>
 * <li>Vanilla's own depth texture still holds real scene depth under a pack, because Iris hands it to its own render
 * targets. So it can be attached here directly and entities depth-test against terrain for free.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <b>Draw buffer 0 is deliberately {@code GL_NONE}.</b> The patched entity shaders still write their ordinary colour
 * output at location 0; discarding it is what keeps this pass from ever touching the pack's image. Only attachments
 * 1-6, the classification data, are kept.
 * <p>
 * \u26a0 The six textures are NOT owned here \u2014 they belong to {@link BLibMainTargetMRT}, which allocates them through
 * {@code attachInternal} so that their formats and filtering cannot drift from the no-pack path. This class owns only
 * the framebuffer object.
