/**
 * THE SINGLE SWITCH FOR EVERYTHING THE IRIS SHADER-PACK WORK ADDED. Set {@code -Dblib.iris.stage2=false} and BLib
 * behaves exactly as it did before that work existed.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why one switch instead of the several diagnostic flags it replaces.</b> The shader-pack work changed behaviour at
 * six separate points, and a fault appeared in the NO-pack path that could not be pinned to any of them by reading the
 * code — two separate mechanisms were proposed from inspection and both turned out to be wrong. What was missing was
 * never another probe; it was the ability to run the SAME BUILD with and without the changes and compare. That is all
 * this does.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it disables when false</b>, each restoring the exact prior behaviour:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link BLibIrisClassificationPass} does not run at all.</li>
 * <li>{@link BLibMainTargetMRT#reconcileForShaderPackState()} becomes a no-op, so the auxiliary attachments are
 * created once at framebuffer creation and never destroyed or recreated.</li>
 * <li>{@link BLibPostEffectPipeline} stands down whenever a shader pack is active, as it always used to.</li>
 * <li>{@link BLibGbufferUniforms} returns to gating on {@code isAttached()} rather than {@code isAttachedToMainTarget()},
 * and stops making an exception for the classification pass.</li>
 * <li>{@link BLibDepthSnapshot#capture()} is skipped again while a pack is active.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <b>Default is ON.</b> The switch exists to isolate a fault, not to ship the feature disabled.
 * <p>
 * ⚠ This is a bisect tool with a real cost: every site it guards is a branch that has to stay correct in both states.
 * Once the no-pack fault is understood, delete this class and the branches with it rather than leaving a second
 * configuration nobody tests.
