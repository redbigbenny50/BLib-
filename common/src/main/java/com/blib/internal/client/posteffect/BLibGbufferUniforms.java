/**
 * Per-shader hooks that run after every {@code ShaderInstance.apply()}:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Sets the patcher-injected {@code BlibHeldItem} uniform to flag held-item draws (the patched fragment writes the
 * {@code 0.875} held-item mask category when this is non-zero, which the thermal post detects and short-circuits to
 * original color).</li>
 * <li>Sets the patcher-injected {@code BlibBackgroundEntity} (lane A) and {@code BlibBackgroundEntity2} (lane B)
 * uniforms to flag entity draws that should render as part of the world background. The patched fragment packs the two
 * lanes into {@code entityMask.g} as {@code 0.25 * laneA + 0.5 * laneB}, so the four combinations land at 0.0 / 0.25 /
 * 0.5 / 0.75. Consumer post-effects sample {@code .g} and decode to per-lane flags (or just check {@code .g > 0.5} for
 * legacy "any background" behavior, since that matches lane B alone).</li>
 * <li>Toggles {@code glColorMaski} for the auxiliary attachments (1-6) based on whether the bound shader is one we've
 * categorized for the thermal pipeline. Patched shaders write valid auxiliary data and have full writes enabled.
 * Unpatched shaders — entity shadows, the block-outline wireframe, glints, leashes, crumbling overlay, etc. — have
 * writes to attachments 1-6 SUPPRESSED entirely. That's what stops them from blending zeros (or driver-undefined
 * garbage) on top of the underlying terrain/entity's already- written mask byte and corrupting it. The auxiliary
 * content the post shader reads at those pixels is whatever the underlying classified draw left there, which is exactly
 * what we want.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Cache: vanilla calls {@code apply()} hundreds of times per frame, so the {@code glGetUniformLocation} lookup is
 * cached per program ID. Patched/unpatched lookup is name-based and cheap (a handful of string equals).
