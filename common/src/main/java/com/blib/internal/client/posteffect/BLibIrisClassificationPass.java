/**
 * RE-RENDERS VISIBLE ENTITIES INTO {@link BLibIrisAuxTarget} SO THE VISION HAS A CLASSIFICATION TO READ WHILE A SHADER
 * PACK OWNS THE MAIN RENDER TARGET.
 * <p>
 * <b>The precedent.</b> This is the shape vanilla's own glowing-entity outline uses \u2014 a separate render target,
 * entities drawn into it a second time, a post pass that reads it \u2014 and that keeps working with shader packs on. The
 * pattern is proven; this is not a new idea, only a new consumer.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the cost is acceptable.</b> Measured on his own world across 112 samples: a median of 34 entities within 64
 * blocks and a maximum of 38. Drawing those a second time, only while the mask is down, is not a meaningful expense \u2014
 * and it was worth measuring rather than guessing, because a hive in view is a very different number from a few cows.
 * <p>
 * \u26a0\u26a0 THIS PASS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT WRITE DEPTH. It borrows the main target's depth texture so entities occlude
 * against terrain correctly, but writing into it would corrupt the depth buffer Iris is still using for its own
 * composite passes. Depth TEST on, depth WRITE off, always.
 * <p>
 * <b>Stage 1 scope.</b> Per-entity classification uniforms are still pushed by consumer mixins that currently stand
 * themselves down under a pack, so at this stage entities land in the mask with default classification rather than
 * their thermal categories. That is expected: the question this stage answers is whether the pixels arrive at all.
 * {@code -Dblib.iris.diag=true} logs what actually landed.
